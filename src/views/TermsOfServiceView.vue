          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>10. Acknowledge and assumption of risks</strong></p>
        <p>
          10.1 You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing, owning, holding and using Tokens and that
          blockchain and virtual currencies / tokens are unveriﬁed technologies that are beyond control of the Company. In particular, by
          purchasing Tokens, You bear full responsibility for any risks designated in these Terms and You expressly acknowledge and assume
          the risks, including, but not limited to, as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Development failure. The Company is committed to the successful creation of the Tokens to be used within the Interface in the
            context of the Project. However, there is a risk that the Interface may not be successfully deployed and the Tokens not created.
            The project of the Company is still at an early stage and its completion may be prevented by a number of factors such as lack of
            funding or, if implemented, for lack of success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of amendments in functionality and rights. Lingo Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities
            or features, express or implied, except for those which are speciﬁcally described in the [White Paper] and which may change from
            time to time.
          </li>
          <li>Non-refundable Token. The Company is under no obligation to refund You with Lingo Tokens for any reason.</li>
          <li>
            Risks associated with the Company. There is a risk that key team members of the Company, whose knowledge and experience are
            essential to a successful development and deployment leave the Company thereby compromising the success of the project. Further,
            start-up companies always involve a high degree of risks (ﬁnancial, operating risks, etc.) and issues which cannot be solved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal and regulatory framework. The legal and regulatory framework of national and international jurisdictions with regards to
            blockchain technology is in development and subject to changes. Regulatory measures might impact Tokens and/or Interface
            negatively in a number of ways. The Company may cease to operate in a country or even abandon certain features of the project if
            regulatory action or changes in laws or regulations make it illegal to operate in such country or it is not commercially
            desirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such country. This includes, in particular, the risk that
            the Tokens cannot be used or can no longer be used for its intended purpose due to changes in the legal or regulatory framework
            and may become unusable under certain circumstances. The Company therefore does not guarantee that the Tokens are legal in all
            jurisdictions. The Purchaser solely bears all legal or ﬁnancial consequences if the Tokens are considered as securities /
            financial instruments or deemed illegal in the Purchaser’s respective jurisdiction. The Purchaser is obliged to verify whether
            the acquisition and disposal of the Tokens is legal in their jurisdiction, and by accepting the provisions of this Terms, the
            Purchaser agrees not to use the Tokens in case their use is considered not legal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tax risks. There are numerous risks in connection with the Tokens and tax law and regulations. You are obliged to seek Your own
            tax advice and evaluate tax consequences in connection with purchasing, holding, using and selling the Tokens, which may result
            in adverse tax consequences to You.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of Bugs, Theft and Hacking. The Project is at an early stage and the blockchain technology is a new technology. There is no
            assurance that such technology will be free of viruses, bugs or other harmful components or operate as intended. There is a risk
            that the Tokens may unintentionally contain ﬂaws or bugs in its source code that aﬀect the use of Tokens or cause the loss of a
            Token.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smart contracts. There is a risk that any smart contract used for the distribution of the Tokens contains security gaps, errors
            or dysfunctionalities which may adversely aﬀect the distribution and use of the Tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of losing access. A wallet and the Tokens it contains can only be accessed using the private key assigned to the wallet or
            a respective smart contract controlling the wallet. You are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining Your wallet, private
            keys, any token, cryptocurrency or virtual assets associated therewith, as well as for the protection of the private key and the
            wallet against unauthorized access by third parties. Loss of the private keys can lead to irretrievable loss of the Tokens. The
            Company recommends seeking professional advice on the safe management of private keys. Further, Tokens are typically transferred
            digitally, through electronic media not controlled or regulated by any entity. To the extent a Token is transferred erroneously
            to the wrong destination, You may be unable to recover the Tokens as Token transactions are irrevocable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blockchain. The Tokens are based on blockchain protocol and architecture. Thus, a malfunction, unintended function, or
            unforeseen operation of the blockchain may cause the Tokens to become defective or function unexpectedly or unintentionally. The
            future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security weakness. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Purchaser’s wallets, or the Tokens
            in variety of ways, including but not limited to denial-of-service attacks, spooﬁng, smurﬁng, malicious attacks or
            consensus-based attacks, which may result, for instance, that the Tokens being stolen or inaccessible without chance of
            recovery. Blockchains are exposed to mining attacks which may put the smart contract at risk. An attack or a breach of security
            could result in a loss of private keys, data or Tokens, unauthorized transactions, an interruption of the Blockchain for an
            extended period of time, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and legal and ﬁnancial exposure. There can be no
            assurance that the security measures will be eﬀective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of Uninsured Losses. Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other ﬁnancial institutions, funds held using blockchain
            technology are generally uninsured. In the event of any loss, there is no public insurer, or private insurer, to oﬀer recourse
            to You.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risks Associated with Markets for the Tokens. The Company cannot control the market of the Tokens and it is possible that there
            is a lack of interest with regards to the Tokens, which could negatively impact the creation and deployment of the Tokens as
            well as the Interface and therefore all intended utilities of the Tokens. The Tokens are intended to be used solely in
            connection with the Interface, and the Company does not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external
            valuation of the Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using the Tokens and could therefore create illiquidity
            risk with respect to the Tokens You hold. Even if secondary trading of the Token is facilitated by third party exchanges, such
            exchanges may be new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks.
            Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to the Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a
            virtual asset and/or or ﬁat currency). It is also possible that no secondary markets ever develop for the Tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risks Associated with Our Intellectual Property. The Company may consider some technology that it develops to be proprietary.
            The Company may also rely on trademark, copyright, and trade secret law to protect its rights. However, these laws oﬀer only
            limited protection. In addition, other countries may provide the Company with little to no intellectual property right
            protection. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property, the value of the Tokens may decline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risks Associated with Data Privacy Laws. There are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and
            industry-speciﬁc requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving
            certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the reputation, erode user conﬁdence in the eﬀectiveness of its
            security measures, negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the Tokens, which
            would reduce or diminish the value of the Tokens and cause the Project to fail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unanticipated Risks. Utility tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. There are risks associated with Your
            purchase, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize
            as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks.
          </li>
        </ol>
